About
=====
cape is an asynchronous multi component framework with distributed computing
capabilities. A lot of aspects of message oriented middleware systems are
integrated, too, since one of the goals is driving a fully fledged, planetwide
Delay Tolerant Network (DTN).

It's current primary development focus points are:

* operate our fleet of naval development and testing ships (e.g. the MS0x00)

* aggregate, process and (re-)distribute navigational data from many
  different sources to many different targets

* form and manage a meshed DTN

Usage is pretty unlimited, as long as you can do it reasonably in Python.

Warning
=======
This README, as cape itself, is young and thus heavy WiP!

Installation
============
The installation is being overhauled to an automated process via Python's
setuptools. The long instructions here will still be valid, especially for
Debian systems.

If you're not on any strange/colourful/alien platform, try the
Quick Setup.

Quick Setup
-----------
This is a debian optimized quicksetup.

Dependencies
''''''''''''
What you'll need (bare minimum):
* mercurial
* python setuptools
* python headers
* gcc
* mongodb

As root:
::
    apt-get install mercurial gcc python-dev python-setuptools mongodb

cape
''''
This quick setup cannot install all extras and addons, but the core cape
system. Missing things are: Mapnik2 and Mongo connectors.

Warning: You should use a virtual environment to install cape. See next
chapter! If you don't want to use a virtualenviroment, you will need to
execute the next commands as root (e.g. with sudo).

Clone manually (cape is not yet published on pypi) and install via setup.py:
::
    hg clone https://repos.hackerfleet.org/cape/cape
    cd cape
    python setup.py install

All required dependencies should be installed automatically via PyPi, Python's
official package repository.

There are some other packages in preparation, see
https://repos.hackerfleet.org/cape for more information.  You will probably
want to install cape.tkadmin, if you want to develop cape components:
::
    sudo apt-get install python-tk
    hg clone https://repos.hackerfleet.org/cape/cape.tkadmin
    cd cape.tkadmin
    python setup.py install

Virtual Environment
-------------------
E.g. Debian has a lot of prepackaged python libraries. Please do not use them.
Instead, setup a virtual environment and install into this via pip if possible.
This also enhances security and makes development a lot easier.

Before downloading and installing cape, make sure you have python-virtualenv
and set up an environment:
::
    virtualenv venv
    cd venv
    source bin/activate

Some features/components rely on external non-python software and thus need the 
appropriate packages installed.


MongoDB on armhf
----------------
If you're installing dependencies on debian's armhf port, you'll notice mongodb
missing. This is because the non-x86 port of mongodb isn't yet debian-packaged.

So you will need to install and build mongodb from hand here.
This document describes the procedure quite well:

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/docs/building.debian.etch.ec2.md

Mind you, there is no need to use gcc4.1 in sid or wheezy, so skip
that part.

Configuration
-------------
cape needs a configuration to do anything. Automatic generation of the necessary
data is in preparation.
Until then, copy
    cape/doc/cape.conf.example
to
    /etc/cape/cape.conf
and modify if necessary.

Running & Tests
---------------
Now you should be ready to start the system with:
::
    cape.py

cape logs (by default) to /tmp/cape.log if not specified otherwise.
You should inspect this file if you encounter problems.

Tests haven't been written, yet. This is going to be funny work. Very.

AddOns
------
There are some init-scripts and helper utilities. You can find these in
cape/Tools. Their integration into your system will be implemented as command
for the automated installation procedure, soon. In the meantime read the files
for more documentation.

Documentation
=============
After installation, try:
::
    pydoc cape
