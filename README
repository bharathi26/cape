About
=====
cape is an asynchronous multi component framework with distributed computing
capabilities. A lot of aspects of message oriented middleware systems are
integrated, too, since one of the goals is driving a fully fledged, planetwide
Delay Tolerant Network (DTN).

It's current primary development focus points are:

* operate our fleet of naval development and testing ships (e.g. the MS0x00)

* aggregate, process and (re-)distribute navigational data from many
  different sources to many different targets

* form and manage a meshed DTN

Usage is pretty unlimited, as long as you can do it reasonably in Python.

Warning
=======
This README, as cape itself, is young and thus heavy WiP!

Installation
============
The installation is being overhauled to an automated process via Python's
setuptools. The long instructions here will still be valid, especially for
Debian systems.

If you're not on any strange/colourful/alien platform, try the
Quick Setup.

Quick Setup
-----------
This quick setup cannot install all extras and addons, but the core cape
system. Missing things are: Mapnik2 and Mongo connectors.
Clone manually (cape is not yet published on pypi) and install via setup.py:
::
    hg clone https://repos.hackerfleet.org/hg/repos/cape
    cd cape
    sudo python setup.py install

All required dependencies should be installed automatically via PyPi, Python's
official package repository.

Debian
------
Debian has a lot of prepackaged libs. Please do not use them. Instead, setup a 
virtual environment and install into this via pip if possible.

Some features rely on external non-python software and thus need the appropriate
packages installed.

MongoDB on armhf
''''''''''''''''
If you're installing dependencies on debian's armhf port, you'll notice mongodb
missing. This is because the non-x86 port of mongodb isn't yet debian-packaged.

So you will need to install and build mongodb from hand here.
This document describes the procedure quite well:

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/docs/building.debian.etch.ec2.md

Mind you, there is no need to use gcc4.1 in sid or wheezy, so skip
that part.

Dependencies
''''''''''''
This needs rework towards a virtual environment friendly process. WiP!
As root:
::
    apt-get install python-setuptools python-serial python-jsonpickle \
    python-configobj python-pmw python-pymongo \
    python-imaging python-imaging-tk \
    mongodb mercurial
    

cape
====
Installing cape itself will soon be automated via pypi, for now clone manually:
::
    hg clone https://hackerfleet.org/hg/cape
    cd cape
    python setup.py install

Running & Tests
---------------
Now you should be ready to start the system with:
::
    cape.py

Tests haven't been written, yet. This is going to be funny work. Very.

AddOns
------
There are some init-scripts and helper utilities. You can find these in
cape/Tools. Their integration into your system will be implemented as command
for the automated installation procedure, soon. In the meantime read the files
for more documentation.

Documentation
=============
After installation, try:
::
    pydoc cape
