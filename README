This Readme is WiP!

= About =
This is the Readme file for the ANRV Software.
ANRV stands for "Autonomous Naval Robotic Vehicle".

= Installation =

== Debian ==
=== MongoDB on armhf ===
If you're installing dependencies on debian's armhf port, you'll
notice mongodb missing. This is because the non-x86 port of mongodb 
isn't yet debian-packaged.

So you will need to install and build mongodb from hand here.
This document describes the procedure quite well:

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/docs/building.debian.etch.ec2.md

Mind you, there is no need to use gcc4.1 in sid or wheezy, so skip
that part.

=== Dependencies ===
As root:

apt-get install python-setuptools python-serial python-jsonpickle \
                python-configobj python-pmw python-pynongo \
                python-imaging python-imaging-tk python-mapnik2 \
                mongodb \
                mercurial

svn checkout http://kamaelia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ kamaelia
cd kamaelia/Code/Python/Axon
python setup.py install
cd ../Kamaelia
python setup.py install
cd ../../../../

=== RAIN ===

hg clone https://www.hackerfleet.org/hg/ms0x00
cd ms0x00
python setup.py install

== Running & Tests ==
Now you should be ready to start the temporary Scaffold Server script with:

python ScaffoldServer

Tests haven't been written, yet. This is going to be funny. Very.
